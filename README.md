# Hacash-Telegram-Bot

I am creating an open source project for Hacash in Telegram, it will be known as HacashBot

Progress:
Set up a bot using BotFather >> [HacashBot](t.me/HacashBot)
Bot is in beta:
Problems:
[x]1. Consensus to >248 and <240
[x]2. Rounding Up numbers still in debate since lower values can't be represented in higher formats.
[x]3. Non-digits get rejected.

On-going features:
[x]1. Web Scraping on http://explorer.hacashpool.com/address/foo or http://block.hacash.org/address/ to check balance.
[ ]2. Adding icons to menu-reply.

# Hacash-Telegram-Bot

I am creating an open source project for Hacash in Telegram, it will be known as HacashBot

Progress:
Set up a bot using BotFather >> [HacashBot](t.me/HacashBot)
Bot is in beta:
Problem:
1. Consensus to >248 and <240
2. Rounding Up numbers still in debate since lower values can't be represented in higher formats.
3. Non-digits get rejected.

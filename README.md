# Hacash-Telegram-Bot

I am creating an open source project for Hacash in Telegram, it will be known as HacashBot

Progress:
Set up a bot using BotFather >> [HacashBot](t.me/HacashBot)
Bot is in beta:
Issues:
- [x] 1. Consensus to >248 and <240
- [x] 2. Rounding Up numbers still in debate since lower values can't be represented in higher formats.
- [x] 3. Non-digits get rejected.

On-going features:
- [x] 1. HAC formatter
- [x] 2. Web Scraping on http://explorer.hacashpool.com/address/foo or http://block.hacash.org/address/ to check balance by using BeautifulSoup
- [ ] 3. Adding icons to menu-reply.
- [ ] 4. Web Scraping dynamic data using Selenium.
